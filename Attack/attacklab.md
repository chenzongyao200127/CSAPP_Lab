# The Attack Lab: Understanding Buffer Overflow Bugs

# Introduction

This assignment involves generating a total of five attacks on two programs having different security vulnerabilities. Outcomes you will gain from this lab include:

 - You will learn different ways that attackers can exploit security vulnerabilities when programs do not safeguard themselves well enough against buffer overflows.

 - Through this, you will get a better understanding of how to write programs that are more secure, as well as some of the features provided by compilers and operating systems to make programs less vulnerable

 - You will gain a deeper understanding of the stack and parameter-passing mechanisms of x86-64 machine code

 - You will gain a deeper understanding of how x86-64 instructions are encoded.

 - You will gain more experience with debugging tools such as GDB and OBJDUMP.

Note: In this lab, you will gain firsthand experience with methods used to exploit security weaknesses in operating systems and network servers. 

Our purpose is to help you learn about the runtime operation of programs and to understand the nature of these security weaknesses so that you can avoid them when you write system code. 

We do not condone the use of any other form of attack to gain unauthorized access to any system resources.

*You will want to study Sections 3.10.3 and 3.10.4 of the CS:APP3e book as reference material for this lab.*
